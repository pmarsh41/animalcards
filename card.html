			<p>Since panthers come from different species of big cat, there is a wide variety of panther facts relating to the environments which they can inhabit. Black leopards are common in Africa and Asia. They are found in locations with dense vegetation, such as the slopes of African mountain ranges (Mount Kenya for example) and tropical forests in areas of China, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
